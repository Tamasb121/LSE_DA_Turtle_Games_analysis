# Assignment template

## Scenario
## You are a data analyst working for Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and 
## retailer. They manufacture and sell their own products, along with sourcing
## and selling products manufactured by other companies. Their product range 
## includes books, board games, video games and toys. They have a global 
## customer base and have a business objective of improving overall sales 
##performance by utilising customer trends. 

## In particular, Turtle Games wants to understand:
## - how customers accumulate loyalty points (Week 1)
## - how useful are remuneration and spending scores data (Week 2)
## - can social data (e.g. customer reviews) be used in marketing 
##     campaigns (Week 3)
## - what is the impact on sales per product (Week 4)
## - the reliability of the data (e.g. normal distribution, Skewness, Kurtosis)
##     (Week 5)
## - if there is any possible relationship(s) in sales between North America,
##     Europe, and global sales (Week 6).

# Week 4 assignment: EDA using R

## The sales department of Turtle games prefers R to Python. As you can perform
## data analysis in R, you will explore and prepare the data set for analysis by
## utilising basic statistics and plots. Note that you will use this data set 
## in future modules as well and it is, therefore, strongly encouraged to first
## clean the data as per provided guidelines and then save a copy of the clean 
## data for future use.

# Instructions
# 1. Load and explore the data.
##  - Remove redundant columns (Ranking, Year, Genre, Publisher) by creating 
##      a subset of the data frame.
##  - Create a summary of the new data frame.

# 2. Create plots to review and determine insights into data set.
##  - Create scatterplots, histograms and boxplots to gain insights into
##      the Sales data.

##  - Note your observations and diagrams that could be used to provide
##      insights to the business.
# 3. Include your insights and observations.

# 3. Observations and insights

# Product numbers are not separately assigned for each product by platform. One product
# number covers the same product for all platforms. Perhaps it worth to look into
# this later, which platform works for products.

# Raw data loaded from CSV file. 352 observations in 9 columns.

# Fairly clean data, additionally corrected 2 rows where year value was NA.

# I identified unusual pattern between the Global Sales and the Ranking column.
# It needs to be checked why global ranking looks to be the same as
# Turtle Games sales ranking. 

# Generally there must be potential in exploring on a more granular level
# and some clarification before that with stakeholders can be useful.

# Trends can be identified by comparing recent releases with earlier games.
# Sales figures could include accumulation of yearly sales so it needs to be clarified,
# otherwise comparison with new products does not make sense. The pattern shows that from 
# 2010 figures get slightly lower. Why is the last release date 2016? 

# From the business perspective important details are missing like profitability and sales price.
# This could impact the direction of further analysis. Otherwise it is just comparing products
# that have higher sales numbers to those which have lower, trying to find patterns.

# The difference between the NA and EU sales varies by product and by sales platform. This
# can be looked at how to improve EU sales, NA sales or Other sales. There are platforms
# where the difference between EU and NA is smaller.

# I included a simple metric, difference between NA and EU sales (Sales_gap) and added
# a new calculated columen (Other_Sales).

# Data explorer shows high correlation between sales regions. Perhaps worth to visit 
# the data explorer function later for a deeper analysis.

# Week 5 assignment: Cleaning and manipulating data using R

## Utilising R, you will explore, prepare and explain the normality of the data
## set based on plots, Skewness, Kurtosis, and a Shapiro-Wilk test. Note that
## you will use this data set in future modules as well and it is, therefore, 
## strongly encouraged to first clean the data as per provided guidelines and 
## then save a copy of the clean data for future use.

## Instructions
# 1. Load and explore the data.
##  - Continue to use the data frame that you prepared in the Week 4 assignment. 
##  - View the data frame to sense-check the data set.
##  - Determine the `min`, `max` and `mean` values of all the sales data.
##  - Create a summary of the data frame.
# 2. Determine the impact on sales per product_id.
##  - Use the group_by and aggregate functions to sum the values grouped by
##      product.
##  - Create a summary of the new data frame.
# 3. Create plots to review and determine insights into the data set.
##  - Create scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to gain insights into 
##     the Sales data.
##  - Note your observations and diagrams that could be used to provide 
##     insights to the business.
# 4. Determine the normality of the data set.
##  - Create and explore Q-Q plots for all sales data.
##  - Perform a Shapiro-Wilk test on all the sales data.
##  - Determine the Skewness and Kurtosis of all the sales data.
##  - Determine if there is any correlation between the sales data columns.
# 5. Create plots to gain insights into the sales data.
##  - Compare all the sales data (columns) for any correlation(s).
##  - Add a trend line to the plots for ease of interpretation.
# 6. Include your insights and observations.

# 5. Observations and insights

# Product column had to be changed to character from numerical as it is in fact a
# categorical variable.
# Visualisations highlight the relationship between sales in different regions and the
# different scale in the regions. This must be presented to stakeholders with good quality
# visualisations. The correlation matrix shows highest value 0.916 between NA and Global sales.

# Analysis of normality for global sales:
# The data points on the QQ plots look to be far to the normal distribution line 
# The hypothesis test confirms that there is no normal distribution, the p-value is very low..
# The boxplot and the QQ plot both show the impact of outliers.
# The strong positive skew seen on the histogram is evidenced by the values measured. 
# The excess kurtosis is very high indicating heavy tails and large outliers.
# This pattern is repeated with the different regions

# Beyond the initial findings, further analysis can explore more of the 
# hypothesis, pattern and anomaly.
# Would it add information to merge of two datasets?
# Is there a trend in sales based on genre, year or other variable?
# Is there correlation between age and remuneration?
# How sales and loyalty points are impacted by customer satisfaction based on 
# sentiment analysis.
# Does the number or type of platforms available for the product impact sales?
# Why the game 107 is such an outlier product, the most successful with 67.85 mio £ global sales?
# EU outperforms NA for some games?
# Age only starts from 17?
# Year is only until 2016?

# Overall, some information like pricing and profit margins are not there so 
# it would make sense to consult stakeholders for direction.

# Most importantly, based on the grouping of products and platforms the business seems to be
# heavily relying on sales of Nintendo products, approximately 48 percent of the Global_Sales and
# representing 17 products in the top 20 ranking. It must be checked how the sales of these
# products is achieved and ensured by Turtle Games. Loosing this business due to external factors 
# would have an extreme impact on the company too.

# Week 6 assignment: Making recommendations to the business using R

## The sales department wants to better understand if there is any relationship
## between North America, Europe, and global sales. Therefore, you need to
## investigate any possible relationship(s) in the sales data by creating a 
## simple and multiple linear regression model. Based on the models and your
## previous analysis (Weeks 1-5), you will then provide recommendations to 
## Turtle Games based on:
##   - Do you have confidence in the models based on goodness of fit and
##        accuracy of predictions?
##   - What would your suggestions and recommendations be to the business?
##   - If needed, how would you improve the model(s)?
##   - Explain your answers.

# Instructions
# 1. Load and explore the data.
##  - Continue to use the data frame that you prepared in the Week 5 assignment. 
# 2. Create a simple linear regression model.
##  - Determine the correlation between the sales columns.
##  - View the output.
##  - Create plots to view the linear regression.
# 3. Create a multiple linear regression model
##  - Select only the numeric columns.
##  - Determine the correlation between the sales columns.
##  - View the output.
# 4. Predict global sales based on provided values. Compare your prediction to
#      the observed value(s).
##  - NA_Sales_sum of 34.02 and EU_Sales_sum of 23.80.
##  - NA_Sales_sum of 3.93 and EU_Sales_sum of 1.56.
##  - NA_Sales_sum of 2.73 and EU_Sales_sum of 0.65.
##  - NA_Sales_sum of 2.26 and EU_Sales_sum of 0.97.
##  - NA_Sales_sum of 22.08 and EU_Sales_sum of 0.52.
# 5. Include your insights and observations.

# 5. Observations and insights.

# NA_Sales is a highly significant predictor of Global_Sales, it explains 83.95% of the variability,
# with a very low p-value. Residuals show no pattern which can be seen on the scatterplot from the
# distance from the regression line. 
# Multiple linear regression improves predictions and the combined accuracy increases to 0.967. 
# However there is the problem of the normality of the variables. The scatterplots indicate that it 
# should be possible to adjust the model by removing some outliers.
